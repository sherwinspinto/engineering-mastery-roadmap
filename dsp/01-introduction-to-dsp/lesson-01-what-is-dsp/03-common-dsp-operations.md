# üõ†Ô∏è Common DSP Operations

DSP applies various algorithms to transform or analyze digital signals.

### Common Tasks
- **Sampling & Quantization**
- **Filtering** (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass)
- **Convolution**
- **Transformations** (Fourier, Z-transform)
- **Compression** (MP3, JPEG)
- **Noise reduction**
- **Feature extraction**

Each operation serves a unique goal, such as enhancing clarity, reducing size, or extracting information.
