# ðŸ”„ Analog vs Digital Signals

## Analog Signals
- Continuous in time and amplitude
- Can represent infinite values
- Example: audio from a microphone

## Digital Signals
- Discrete in time and/or amplitude
- Represented by numbers (binary)
- Example: MP3 audio, digital photos

## Why Digital?
- Easier to store, replicate, and transmit
- More resilient to noise
- Enables real-time processing using software
