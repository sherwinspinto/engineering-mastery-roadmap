# ðŸ§© Basics of Signals and Systems

## What is a Signal?

A **signal** is a function that conveys information. It may vary with time, space, or another independent variable.

- Examples: voice waveform, ECG, stock price curve

## What is a System?

A **system** is an entity that processes signals. In DSP, we analyze how systems respond to input signals.

### Key Concepts
- **Continuous vs. Discrete Time**: Continuous varies smoothly; discrete is sampled at intervals.
- **Linear vs. Nonlinear Systems**
- **Time-invariant vs. Time-varying Systems**
