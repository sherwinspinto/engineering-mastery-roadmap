# 🧠 Engineering Mastery Roadmap: GitHub-Powered Learning System

Welcome to your personal learning ecosystem — built for mastery, intuition, and long-term growth.

## 🎯 Purpose
Re-learn and master key mathematical and engineering concepts with a focus on:
- **Intuition-first learning**: Understand the *why* before the *how*
- **Visualization and simulation**: See the concepts come to life
- **Deliberate practice**: Apply, reflect, and refine
- **Long-term tracking**: Use Git + Markdown to build a second brain

## ✅ Roadmap Progress Tracker
| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Linear Algebra | 🔄 In Progress | Starting with visual matrices |
| Calculus | ⏳ Not Started | To begin after linear algebra |
| ODEs & Laplace | ⏳ Not Started | Prereq: Calculus |
| Complex Numbers & Transforms | ⏳ Not Started | Used in DSP/control |

## 🚀 Current Focus: Visual Linear Algebra (Week 1–2)
### Goals
- Build geometric intuition for matrices, vectors, and transformations
- Understand eigenvectors and their real-world applications
- Simulate transformations in 2D and 3D using Python

### Resources
- 📺 [Essence of Linear Algebra – 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
- 📘 Book: *Linear Algebra Done Right* (optional, deep dives)
- 🧮 [Matrix calculator + visualizer (e.g., GeoGebra)](https://www.geogebra.org/m/KfuF7rKx)

### Practice
- [ ] Build 2D transformation grid using `matplotlib`
- [ ] Animate basis vector transformations
- [ ] Implement simple PCA and visualize data alignment

### Reflections
- What mental models helped you *see* the math?
- Which operations feel mechanical vs. intuitive?
- What surprised you?

## 🔁 Learning Philosophy
- **Visualization-first**: Every topic starts with a visual or physical interpretation
- **Deliberate Practice**: Apply the concept in a small project or notebook
- **Spaced repetition**: Review key concepts weekly
- **Linking ideas**: Connect topics across modules (e.g., eigenvectors → state space)

---

## 💡 Tips
- Use Git branches for experimental learning (e.g., `linear-algebra-rewrite`)
- Commit messages as learning notes: `feat: understood eigendecomposition for 2x2 matrices`
- Use issues or TODO lists in each markdown to track confusions and deep dives
- Keep a personal `learning-journal.md` to reflect every week

---

## 🧰 Tools
- Markdown Editor: VS Code + Markdown Preview Enhanced
- Math: LaTeX inside Markdown (`$e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x$`)
- Code: Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for all simulations
- Git: Track every breakthrough, cleanup, or note as a versioned step forward
