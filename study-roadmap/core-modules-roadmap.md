# üìö Core Modules Roadmap: Math Foundations, DSP, Signals & Systems

This roadmap structures the parallel learning of three core disciplines‚ÄîMath Foundations, DSP, and Signals and Systems‚Äîfor maximum synergy and progress tracking.

## üîπ Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1‚Äì2)
**Goal:** Build the mathematical and conceptual base for digital signal processing.

| Module             | Focus                                                   | Lessons                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Math Foundations   | Vectors, matrices, linear combinations                  | `lesson-01-vectors-and-spaces`, `basis`, `dimension`, `linear independence` |
| Signals & Systems  | What is a signal, classification of signals, operations | `lesson-01-intro-signals`                |
| DSP                | What is DSP, continuous vs discrete, intro concepts     | `lesson-01-what-is-dsp`                  |

## üîπ Phase 2: Signal Digitization (Weeks 3‚Äì4)
**Goal:** Understand the digitization of analog signals and potential pitfalls.

| Module             | Focus                                     | Lessons                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Math Foundations   | Matrix transformations & visualizations     | `lesson-02-matrix-transformations` |
| Signals & Systems  | LTI systems intro, causality, time invariance| `lesson-02-systems-and-classifications` |
| DSP                | Sampling, aliasing, quantization              | `lesson-02-sampling-and-quantization`   |

## üîπ Phase 3: Frequency & System Analysis (Weeks 5‚Äì6)
**Goal:** Move into frequency-domain analysis and system response.

| Module             | Focus                                            | Lessons                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Math Foundations   | Eigenvalues/vectors, Fourier basis intuition      | `lesson-03` (planned)             |
| Signals & Systems  | Convolution, Fourier series, Laplace transforms   | `lesson-03` to `lesson-05`        |
| DSP                | DFT/FFT, frequency filtering, windowing techniques| `lesson-03` (planned)             |

## üóÇÔ∏è Tracking & Integration Tips
- Use `README.md` or `lesson-tracker.md` in each module to mark progress and notes.
- Create a weekly log in `learning-journal.md` summarizing your cross-module learning.
- Incorporate code notebooks and visuals to link math, system behavior, and signal analysis.
