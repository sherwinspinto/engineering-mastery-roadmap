## ðŸ“… Week 1 â€” Visual Linear Algebra Kickoff

**What I Did:**
- Started watching 3Blue1Brownâ€™s Essence of Linear Algebra
- Played with matrix transformations in GeoGebra

**What Clicked:**
- Seeing a matrix as a way to remap space
- Eigenvectors as directions that remain unchanged in transformation

**Whatâ€™s Still Fuzzy:**
- Full geometric intuition of complex eigenvalues
- The link between matrix decomposition and system dynamics

**Next Steps:**
- Try coding a matrix grid transformation in Python
- Add notes on determinant visual meaning
