# üìò Lesson 1: Vectors and Vector Spaces

## ‚úÖ Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
- Understand what a vector is (geometrically and algebraically)
- Perform vector addition and scalar multiplication
- Understand linear combinations and span
- Grasp the concept of a vector space
- Identify common vector subspaces like ‚Ñù¬≤ and ‚Ñù¬≥

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Vector?

### Algebraic View:
A vector is an **ordered list of numbers** representing a position or direction in space.
- Example:
  $$
  \vec{v} = [3, -1, 2] \in \mathbb{R}^3
  $$
- Algebraically, a vector is like a coordinate list or a directional instruction ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily point to a location unless you define it with respect to the origin. 
- It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwhere you are‚Äù, but ‚Äúhow to move‚Äù ‚Äî 3 units in x, -1 unit in y, 2 units in z.

  
### Geometric View:
A vector can be visualized as an **arrow** from the origin, indicating **magnitude and direction**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vector Operations

### ‚ûï Vector Addition:
$$
\vec{u} = [1, 2], \quad \vec{v} = [3, -1]
$$

$$
\vec{u} + \vec{v} = [1 + 3, 2 + (-1)] = [4, 1]
$$

### ‚úñÔ∏è Scalar Multiplication:
$$
2 \cdot \vec{v} = 2 \cdot [3, -1] = [6, -2]
$$

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Combinations and Span

- A **linear combination** is any expression like:
  $$
  a_1\vec{v}_1 + a_2\vec{v}_2 + \dots + a_n\vec{v}_n
  $$

- The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of all vectors that can be formed by linear combinations of them.

  Example:
  $$
  \text{Span}(\{[1, 0], [0, 1]\}) = \mathbb{R}^2
  $$

  $$
  \text{Span}(\{[1, 1]\}) = \text{Line through origin at 45¬∞}
  $$
- Example of a vector that lies in a span. \
 $ \vec{v}_1 = [2,1], \vec{v}_2 = [-1,1], \vec{w} = [1,3] $ \
We need to show that $\vec{w} = [1,3] $ is in the span of $ \vec{v}_1 = [2,1], \vec{v}_2 = [-1,1]$ \
so we solve for $a\vec{v}_1 + b\vec{v}_2 = \vec{w}$ \
i.e \
$ a[2,1] + b[-1,1] = [1,3] \:\: which \: gives \: us  \: a=\frac{4}{3} \: and \: b=\frac{5}{3} $ \
this means that $\vec{w}$ is in the span of $\vec{v_1} \: and \: \vec{v_2}$ \
  You can think of it like this:
  If you were standing at the origin and could only walk in the directions of $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$, then yes ‚Äî you could reach the point [1, 3] by walking $\frac{4}{3}$ steps in direction $\vec{v}_1$ and $\frac{5}{3}$ in direction $\vec{v}_2.$

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Vector Space?

A **vector space** is a set of vectors closed under:
- Vector addition
- Scalar multiplication

It must satisfy **8 axioms** (associativity, identity, distributivity, etc.) ‚Äî these will be explored in a later lesson.

üîß Analogy

Think of:
-	**Vector space** definition = rulebook (like the rules of chess)
-	**Span of vectors** = specific pieces following those rules to reach certain positions
-	The span lives inside the larger space defined by the rules

<font color="red">So you don‚Äôt use the span after the vector space is defined ‚Äî rather, span is how you generate actual subsets that are vector spaces, within a broader space (like ‚Ñù¬≥).</font>

### Common Examples:
- $ ( \mathbb{R}^n ) (Euclidean spaces)$
- Set of all polynomials of degree ‚â§ n
- 2√ó2 matrices
- Continuous functions
