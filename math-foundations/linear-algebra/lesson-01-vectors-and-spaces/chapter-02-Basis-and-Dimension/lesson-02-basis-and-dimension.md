# Chapter 02 – Basis and Dimension

This chapter dives into the ideas of **basis** and **dimension**, which help describe the structure and size of vector spaces.

---

## 1️⃣ What is a Basis?

- A set of **linearly independent** vectors that **span** a vector space.
- Think of it as the minimal set of directions needed to generate the space.

---

## 2️⃣ What is Dimension?

- The number of vectors in any basis of a vector space.
- Equivalent to the number of degrees of freedom in the space.

---

## 3️⃣ Examples and Real-World Intuition

- ℝ² has dimension 2; standard basis: {[1, 0], [0, 1]}
- ℝ³ has dimension 3; basis: {[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]}
- A line through the origin has dimension 1
