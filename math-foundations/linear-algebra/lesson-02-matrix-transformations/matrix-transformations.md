# ðŸ“˜ Matrix Transformations â€“ Chapter Roadmap

This section explores how matrices transform space by modifying vectors geometrically.

## ðŸ“‚ Chapters Overview

1. **Chapter 01 â€“ What is a Matrix Transformation?**  
   Understanding matrix multiplication as a transformation of vectors.

2. **Chapter 02 â€“ Scaling and Stretching**  
   Diagonal matrices and how they alter magnitude and direction.

3. **Chapter 03 â€“ Rotation**  
   Using rotation matrices to rotate vectors around the origin.

4. **Chapter 04 â€“ Shearing**  
   Deforming a grid along one axis while preserving the other.

5. **Chapter 05 â€“ Reflection**  
   Flipping vectors across a line or plane using orthogonal matrices.

6. **Chapter 06 â€“ Composition of Transformations**  
   Combining multiple transformations using matrix multiplication.
