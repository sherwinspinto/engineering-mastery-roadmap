# 📘 Lesson 03 – Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how certain vectors maintain their direction (though not necessarily magnitude) under a matrix transformation — and what that tells us about the structure of the matrix.

## 📂 Chapters Overview

1. **Chapter 01 – What is an Eigenvector?**
   Learn the geometric intuition: vectors that don’t rotate under transformation.

2. **Chapter 02 – What is an Eigenvalue?**
   How much those special vectors are stretched or squished.

3. **Chapter 03 – Solving for Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**
   Characteristic equations, det(A - λI) = 0, and eigen decomposition.

4. **Chapter 04 – Diagonalization Preview**
   Why eigenvalues are useful: matrix powers, decoupling systems, and simplification.

5. **Chapter 05 – Real-World Interpretations**
   Dynamical systems, stability, Markov chains, and PCA.
